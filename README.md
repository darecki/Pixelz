# Pixelz
Pixelz is a simple board game. 

## How to play / rules.

# Motivation
I created the project to learn SwiftUI. It will start as a single player game. 

## Further plans:

### Multiplayer 
There are several ideas on what multiplayer features could be added.
- Challenge friends by inviting them to play the same board.
- Add leaderboards.
- Create real time matches.
- Back-end will be created in [Vapor](https://vapor.codes)

### Apple TV app
When the iOS app is finished I plan to create an Apple TV app.

### Android
Later there's a possibility to create an Android app. Either native in Kotlin or in Flutter.
